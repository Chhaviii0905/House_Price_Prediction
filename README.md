# House_Price_Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on its features such as size, location, number of rooms, etc. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains historical data on house prices and their corresponding features.

Requirements:
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)

Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it.
Install the required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in the file Housing.csv. It contains the following columns:

price: The target variable, which represents the house price (dependent variable).
area: The total area of the house.
bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.
stories: The number of stories in the house.
mainroad: Binary feature (0 or 1) representing if the house is on the main road or not.
guestroom: Binary feature (0 or 1) representing if the house has a guest room or not.
basement: Binary feature (0 or 1) representing if the house has a basement or not.
hotwaterheating: Binary feature (0 or 1) representing if the house has hot water heating or not.
airconditioning: Binary feature (0 or 1) representing if the house has air conditioning or not.
parking: The number of parking spaces available with the house.
prefarea: Binary feature (0 or 1) representing if the house is in a preferred location or not.

Usage:
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE of your choice.
Navigate to the project directory and open the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.
Feel free to modify the notebook and experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve the model's accuracy.
